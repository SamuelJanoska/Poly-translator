# Poly-translator

This utility serves to people who like to have a word translated simultaneously into multiple languages. I'm using flask framework for this purpose.

The API itself offers cca 16 languages to be translated to - I will update these in the process if I find out some are not working.

At the time of publishing this I've programmed the app to translate up to five languages at once - I will be happy to add some more if you will utilize it.

It is the first time I have experimented with API to such an extent that I created a working solution. I hope you'll enjoy it!
